This data base simulates the system of an university, where users logging into the application can be students, professors or employees. Each type of users may have different functionalities in the application.
Each career has its own program with predefined subjects to pass in order to get the degree and has its own cost.
The same subject can be dictated in different commissions by different professors.
A student can do more than one career at the same time, can be at multiple commissions and may do many exams.
After an exam, the studentâ€™s mark is stored, and the average mark in that subject can be calculated by getting the average mark between its exams. Then, if passed or not, that information will be stored in the academic record for each student.
A professor can dictate one or more subjects, and can be in more than one commission. Also, a professor can be head of department as well. Them as well as employees work a determined amount of hours per month from which the salary is then calculated.
Employees cannot be head of department neither commissions, they just have a position referring to their work. Ex: administration.
A department is a group of different subjects that may be familiar between them (such as math and algebra), and each of them have someone in charge (head).
Commissions are different courses for the same subject. A single subject may be shared by one or more careers.
